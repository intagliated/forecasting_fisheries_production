### Forecasting the Total Marine Fish Production In Kerala                            
------------------------------


####  Project Overview

The **fisheries sector** plays a vital role in ensuring **nutritional security** in Kerala, providing a livelihood to **2.98%** of the state's population. Kerala holds a **prominent position** in India's marine fish production, contributing nearly **25%** of the total marine catch.However, **climate change and oceanic variations** significantly impact marine ecosystems, affecting fisheries, communities, and economies that depend on them.  
 
Traditionally, **time series forecasting** relied on **linear methods** due to their simplicity and effectiveness in basic prediction tasks. However, with advancements in technology, **Machine Learning (ML)** has emerged as a powerful tool for **predictive modeling**. It enables **data-driven decision-making** by analyzing trends and learning from past patterns.Unlike conventional methods, Machine Learning can **capture complex, nonlinear relationships** in fish production data.  

####  Data Used

Data on Marine Fish production in Kerala (in tonnes) was collected from **CMFRI, Kochi**  and  data  on 
9 significant environmental variables  from **ICOADS** .

#### Significance of Our Study  

Despite Kerala's **strong presence** in India's fisheries sector, **no prior research** has leveraged **machine learning models** for forecasting marine fish production in Kerala. Our study aims to bridge this gap, applying  Machine Learning Methods to **improve accuracy and decision-making** in the fisheries sector.  
 

**Machine Learning Models** - Multiple Linear Regression, Multilayer Perceptron, Radial Basis Function, Random Forest were used to predict the fish production in Kerala and the following results were obtained.
